THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL MOD (THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS)
Also, you still have to do the whole downgrade process to be able to use this.


To-do list:

-Add options to movement (HMD or controller-based);
-Smooth/Snap Turn;
-If not impossible for someone with close to none knowledge of how to actually code, some improvements on the Head Object attachment to the body/camera behavior.
    I saw that the code have some failsafes if the camera wanders far for whatever reason.
I don't intend to do UI based configs, but rather edit a .txt file

If the original developer of the mod finds this wrong or offensive, please contact me and I will cease everything immediatly.

I can read some coding, and kinda understand most of it, but I'm no coder whatsoever, I will gather as much info as I can and try to implement it somehow.
